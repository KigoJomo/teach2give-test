            Are electric cars better for the environment than traditional
            gasoline cars?

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Electric cars produce zero emissions while driving, but the
            environmental impact depends on how the electricity is generated.

          <p>
            Electric cars can have lower maintenance and fuel costs, but the
            initial purchase price is often higher.

            Is the range of electric cars sufficient for long-distance travel?

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Modern electric cars have improved range, but long-distance travel
            may require careful planning and access to charging infrastructure.

          <h4>Are electric cars as safe as gasoline cars?</h4>
          <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
        </button>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Electric cars undergo the same safety testing as gasoline cars and
            can be just as safe, if not safer, due to lower center of gravity
            and fewer moving parts.

          <h4>
            Do electric cars perform as well as gasoline cars in cold weather?
          </h4>
          <span class="toggle-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Electric cars can experience reduced range in cold weather due to
            battery performance, but advancements in technology are mitigating
            these effects.
